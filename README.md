# pytorch_multimodal

Multimodal implementation of sensor data.
Basic of the multimodal-sensor fusion neural network in factory process data.

Using convolution neural network to extract spatial information.
Using recurrent neural network to extract sequential information.

Combine with information from tabular data and information from time series data.
